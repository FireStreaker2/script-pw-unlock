## Script Inject Unlock
Hello!   

This project consists of several things:
* A fake block screen
* An iframe to that block screen on ``index.html``
* A function with a password
* A requirement of the script to be ran to remove the iframe and/or unlock the webpage

In order to change the password, you can go to ``index.html`` line 20 and change the string to suit your own needs   

In order to unlock the webpage/remove the iframe, you must run ``unlock("key")`` but replace "key" with whatever password you set in quotes   

If you can't access the dev console to run the code I would suggest using a script injector to run it instead, as it has the exact same result.
